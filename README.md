## Preview the app locally

1. Ensure you are in the repository root (where `index.html` lives).
2. Start a simple static server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open the site in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ```

If you see a 404/Not Found page, double‑check you started the server from this folder and that `index.html` exists in the current directory. GitHub Pages will work the same way when the file sits at the repo root or on a `gh-pages` branch.
